    {
      "question": "What happens if mutation is not done?",
      "answer": "The property may still be legally yours, but revenue records may not reflect the new ownership, affecting tax payments, government benefits, resale, and dispute claims."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is mutation proof of ownership?",
