    {
      "question": "Why is Sub Division Number required for FMB Sketch?",
      "answer": "Many survey numbers are split into multiple sub-plots. The Sub Division Number ensures we fetch the exact parcel instead of the parent survey map."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I need to select Land Type for downloading FMB?",
      "answer": "Some survey numbers have multiple classification entries. Land Type helps fetch accurate records, especially in mixed-use or reclassified lands."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is FMB used for physical land measurement on ground?",
      "answer": "Yes. Surveyors use FMB measurements and coordinates for field marking, fencing, and identifying boundaries on-site."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does FMB show adjacent survey plots?",
      "answer": "Yes. FMB often shows neighboring parcel boundaries for reference along with subdivision geometry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can FMB Sketch help verify illegal encroachments?",

      "question": "Can FMB be used as proof of ownership?",
      "answer": "No. It is a survey record. Ownership is confirmed through registered Sale Deeds and revenue records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can FMB show water bodies or road access?",
      "answer": "It shows boundary lines, but land-use, zoning, or hydrology checks must be done separately."
