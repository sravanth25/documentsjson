      "question": "What information do I need to search a document through JaaGa?",

    {
      "question": "Is the Document Search result legally valid?",
      "answer": "The indexed search result is sourced from official government records and is accurate for verification, but certified copies may be required for legal submissions or court use."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Document Search different from downloading the actual deed?",

      "question": "Can Document Search reveal past linked deeds?",
      "answer": "Yes. It may provide references to prior documents, which helps trace the title chain during verification."

    },
    {
      "question": "Does Document Search confirm who currently owns the property?",
      "answer": "It confirms recorded transactions for the specific document; full current ownership requires EC and mutation checks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I search old records that are not digitized?",
      "answer": "Digitized data will show instantly. Older records may require manual archival retrieval at the SRO."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the search include land use or zoning?",
      "answer": "No. It focuses on registered deeds. Land use must be verified through planning and local-body authorities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the data from JaaGa authentic?",
